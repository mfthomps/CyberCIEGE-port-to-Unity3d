# CyberCIEGE: Porting to Unity3d #
This repo includes a PoC for porting the CyberCIEGE educational
video game to the Unity3D game engine.  Details are in [this porting report](CyberCIEGEPortingReport.pdf).

The existing CyberCIEGE game is found here: <http://my.nps.edu/web/c3o/cyberciege>
Install it and put this executable (SimSecNoUI.exe) into your CyberCIEGE/game/exe directory: <https://nps.box.com/s/xn88owrsvj0fhskmf10coqz83vccn6dd>

In Unity, open and play the player2 scene.  Use the browse button to select the CyberCIEGE directory,
i.e., where you installed CyberCIEGE.  Then "play".
